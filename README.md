Frontend - Hotel Booking System 

The frontend of a Hotel Booking System is responsible for creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows users to search for hotels, make bookings, view details, and interact with various features like payment and user profiles. The frontend will communicate with the backend through API requests and handle the display of data dynamically.

Key Features of the Frontend
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

User Authentication:

Login/Signup: Forms for registering a new user and logging in. User credentials are sent to the backend for validation. JWT tokens are stored in localStorage for session management.
User Profile: A page where users can view and edit their profile information.

Hotel Search:

Search Interface: A form where users can enter their search criteria such as destination, check-in/check-out dates, and the number of guests.
Search Results: After submitting the search, the available hotels are fetched from the backend and displayed. The user can filter and sort results based on price, location, ratings, etc.

Hotel Details:

A page displaying detailed information about a hotel such as the amenities, images, room types, availability, pricing, and reviews.
Users can add selected rooms to their booking cart.

Booking Process:

Booking Form: After selecting a hotel, users can proceed to a booking form to enter their details like personal information, payment details, etc.
Confirm Booking: The user can review and confirm the booking. Upon confirmation, an API request is sent to the backend to create the booking.

Payment Gateway:

Integration with a payment provider like Stripe or PayPal to securely process payments. Users are redirected to a secure payment page, and upon successful payment, they are redirected back to the frontend with booking confirmation.
Booking Management:

My Bookings: A user dashboard that lists all previous bookings, with options to view details, update, or cancel a booking.
Booking Status: Users can track the status of their bookings (e.g., confirmed, pending).

Responsive Design:

The frontend should be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Notifications:

Display notifications for successful bookings, payment status, and any errors that may occur during the booking or payment process.

Error Handling:

The frontend should handle any errors from the backend gracefully, showing appropriate error messages for failed bookings, invalid inputs, or server issues.
